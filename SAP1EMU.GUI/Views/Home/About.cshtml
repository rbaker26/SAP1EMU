<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>
    The SAP1Emu Project is an open-source suite of tools designed for students and educators teaching introductory courses in Computer Architecture or Digital Electronics.
    It emulates the SAP1 computer from <i>Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown</i>.
    <br />
    This Project is designed to assist in the building and programing of a SAP1 Computer.
    Ben Eater has a great series of videos detailing building the SAP1 computer in a breadboard setup.
    This project compliments Ben Eater's videos by allowing the student access to step-by-step debugging of an emulated SAP1 Computer.
    <br />
    Students can compare the output of their SAP1 to the output of the SAP1Emu Emulator.
    This can be done on a step-by-step basis by setting breakpoints and single-stepping the Emulator through their program.
    <br />
    This Project is free and open-souce.

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<h4>Who am I?</h4>
<p>
    My name is Bob Baker and, at the time of writing, I am a Computer Science Student at Saddleback College in Orange County, California.
    <br />
    The majority of my programming focus is on C++ and C# with an emphasis on ASP.NET Core.
    I have worked with other languages like Java, SQL, and Python, but mostly for academic projects. <br />

<h4>Why this project?</h4>
<p>
    At Saddleback College, I worked as a Teachers Assistant in the Intro to Computer Architecture and Machine Language Lab
    where I assisted students in the building and debugging of SAP1 Computers.
    I found that, while there are a few software solutions to assist students; most were "half-baked", were no longer supported, or did not follow
    the specification outline by Malvino.
    <br />
    For these reasons, I decided to create the SAP1Emu Project.
